            It allows connected users to view, search, suggest and vote for future Epic Rap Battles of History.<br>
            The users need to be logged in using on of the possible identity providers:
        <ul>
            <li> Google </li>
        </ul>

        One user can only vote once for a battle, there is currently only the possibility to upvote.<br>
        One can suggest as many battles a one wants however, please search for a battle before submitting it. <br>
