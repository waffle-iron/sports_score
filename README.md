## Goal

An application to manage scores in sports(real or virtual)

The long term aim is for user to be able to:


  * Register

  * Create organizations that they will use to manage their scores and events

  * Create and join teams

  * Create and join events(Leagues, Tournaments, Matches)

  * Invite other users to join ther team or organisation

  * Choose the privacy level of their events

  * Make the results of an event available live

  * Create sports and specify the rules

  * Allow a live commentary of the events



These are ideas of features  i wan to implement. How i will do so. I don't know yet
